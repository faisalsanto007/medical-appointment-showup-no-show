# medical-appointment-showup-no-show
the objective of this project is to analyze medical data to predict if a patient is going to show up for his appointment or not. I tried to understand what are the factors behind this reason. There are 14 features and 8 of them seemed like to have a relation with a patient's attendance. First I pre-processed the data, although there are no missing data but still needed to fix some features' name and drop some unnecessary columns from the dataset. Then, I performed EDA and finally, I used couple algorithms to test our accuracy. we had around 75% accuracy which is not that good. I also used grid search cv to select the best parameters.
